Solicited Publications Mail™ items only need opaque wrapping.\\n\\nPlease note: Sexually explicit material that’s sent as Personalized Mail™, Postal Code\\n\\nTargeting, or Neighbourhood Mail™ means:\\n\\n\\n\\nImages or representations of nudity that suggest sexual activity\\n\\n\\n\\nImages or representations of sexual intercourse, with no context suggesting violence or degradation\\n\\n\\n\\nWritten text that describes sexual acts in a way that’s more than purely technical, with no context suggesting violence or degradation\\n\\nYou’re solely responsible for ensuring that an item is acceptable for mailing. Without\\n\\nlimiting that responsibility, by depositing an item with us, you represent that the item:\\n\\n\\n\\nHas been properly prepared and paid for\\n\\n\\n\\nDoesn’t constitute non-mailable matter\\n\\n\\n\\nIs allowed to be mailed by applicable law\\n\\n\\n\\nComplies with Canada Post requirements\\n\\nYou acknowledge that in accepting an item for deposit, we may expressly rely on that\\n\\nrepresentation from you.\\n\\nNon-mailable matter\\n\\nPage 2\\n\\nIf we find an international inbound item to be non-mailable, we must immediately\\n\\nremove it from the mail stream. There’s no option to return to sender. The appropriate\\n\\nCanadian legislative authority will destroy the item.\\n\\nFor more information on how we handle non-compliant items visit:\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneral terms and conditions\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-mailable Matter Regulations and the Solicitations by Mail Regulations under the Canada Post Corporation Act\\n\\n\\n\\nFor information on prohibitions, restrictions, and documentation applicable to specific international destinations, see our International destination listing tool\\n\\nPlease note\\n\\nWe’re providing the information on these pages as a convenience only.\\n\\nSome of this information is derived from sources other than Canada\\n\\nPost, and we don’t promise that it’s accurate or complete. All of this\\n\\ninformation is subject to change without notice. It’s your responsibility to make sure that you’re complying with all applicable requirements.\\n\\n2. Illegal mail\\n\\nIt’s an offence if you use the mail for the delivery of:\\n\\n\\n\\nArticles that are obscene, indecent, immoral, or scurrilous\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation relating to bookmaking, pool-setting, betting, or wagering\\n\\n\\n\\nArticles relating to unlawful lottery schemes\\n\\n\\n\\nArticles relating to schemes to deceive or defraud the public\\n\\n\\n\\nArticles or special messages sent to any person intending to obtain money under false pretenses\\n\\nIt’s also an offence to make false representations on any customs document.\\n\\n3. Solicitations by mail\\n\\nNon-mailable matter\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\nSolicitations that have the general appearance of a bill, invoice, or statement of account\\n\\nmust clearly indicate that there’s no obligation to make a payment in relation to the\\n\\nsolicitation unless expressly agreed to by the recipient in exchange for clearly specified\\n\\ngoods or services. Specific wording and format requirements are detailed in the\\n\\nSolicitations by Mail Regulations made under the Canada Post Corporation Act and\\n\\nRegulations.\\n\\nFor convenience, we summarize those requirements below. But you must make sure\\n\\nthat you’re complying with the most current requirements by checking the Department\\n\\nof Justice Canada website.\\n\\nWhere a letter or other mailable matter that’s not a bill, invoice or statement of account\\n\\ndue is in such a form that it has the general appearance of a bill, invoice or statement of\\n\\naccount due, it will have endorsed on its face the following notice:\\n\\n“THIS IS A SOLICITATION FOR THE ORDER OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES AND NOT A\\n\\nBILL, INVOICE OR STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT DUE.

Dangerous goods\\n\\n6.1 Dangerous goods overview\\n\\nDangerous goods, as defined by the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations\\n\\n(TDGR), are non-mailable matter. We won’t accept packages that contain dangerous\\n\\ngoods or that display dangerous goods symbols, except for lithium batteries described\\n\\nin ABCs of mailing. If any evidence of former hazardous material contents is visible, we\\n\\ncan’t accept the package. But in any case, it’s your responsibility to ensure that all\\n\\nmarkings and labels on a package identify the actual contents.\\n\\nYou can reuse boxes for mail shipments if you’ve removed or completely obliterated all\\n\\nformer package markings and labels. Crossing out a label and marking or writing the\\n\\ncurrent contents on a box or package isn’t enough to allow for mailing. You must mark\\n\\nout the former markings and labels completely, even if you wrap the parcel in paper. If\\n\\nthe wrapping becomes damaged during shipment, these markings will be visible and we\\n\\nwon’t deliver the package.\\n\\nYou can find dangerous goods in everyday items or commodities. See our\\n\\nTransportation of dangerous goods classes and index for details.\\n\\nIf you’re a contract customer or Solutions for Small Business (SfSB) cardholder, an\\n\\nexpanded acceptance program is available for:\\n\\n\\n\\nLimited quantities\\n\\n\\n\\nExcepted quantities\\n\\n\\n\\nLithium batteries\\n\\nNon-mailable matter\\n\\nPage 16\\n\\nFor more details, contact your sales representative or call customer service at\\n\\n1‑888‑550‑6333.\\n\\n6.2 Transportation of dangerous goods classes and index\\n\\nIf you’re not sure if the items you intend to mail are dangerous goods, you should:\\n\\n\\n\\nVerify with the manufacturer or supplier\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nContact the Canadian Transport Emergency Centre (CANUTEC) by phone at 1‑613‑992‑4624\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Program website\\n\\nPlease note: Some commodities that contain low concentrations of dangerous goods\\n\\nmay not be regulated if you dilute the dangerous goods to such an extent that the\\n\\nproduct no longer poses a hazard.

Visit our e-store to\\n\\nbuy packaging and wrapping materials.\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\nWe recommend the following tips for most parcels:\\n\\nIn this section\\n\\nChoose a rigid, good quality outer container\\n\\nUse packaging material\\n\\nUse sealing material\\n\\nLabel your item\\n\\nChoose a rigid, good quality outer container\\n\\nThe container must be sturdy enough to protect the item you’re mailing. Depending on\\n\\nthe article you’re mailing, a corrugated cardboard box is generally a good container.\\n\\nIf you’re reusing a box, make sure:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has the strength and integrity for shipping\\n\\n\\n\\nOld shipping labels and barcodes are removed\\n\\n\\n\\nOld addresses and markings are covered up or removed\\n\\nIf you deposit unpackaged items not of a size or shape suitable for wrapping (such as\\n\\npails or tires), you must pay an unpackaged items surcharge.

Preparing shipping documentation\\n\\n5.1 Preparing shipping documentation overview\\n\\nYou must declare each item\\'s actual weight on the shipment order or manifest at the\\n\\ntime of shipping. You may also include the item\\'s dimensions (length, width, and height)\\n\\nor the greater of the actual weight or Volumetric Equivalent (VE) of its actual weight.\\n\\nFor more information, see How to cube an item and calculate the VE of\\n\\nits actual weight.\\n\\nIt’s your responsibility to make sure that your declarations are correct.\\n\\n5.2 Our right to audit\\n\\nThe documentation you submit with your mailing is subject to verification by us at any\\n\\ntime. If we determine your documentation to be incomplete or inaccurate, we may take\\n\\nwhatever action we determine to be appropriate. Please see How we charge for more\\n\\ndetails.\\n\\nPlease note:\\n\\nWhen an item is cubed, the dimensions you give are the dimensions of\\n\\nthe smallest hexahedron (six-sided box) in which the item can be\\n\\ncontained.\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 32\\n\\n5.3 How we charge\\n\\nWe may in our sole discretion invoice you on the basis of:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe documentation you submit with your mailing, including your weight and dimension declarations\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nAny audit by us\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n\\nA default weight of 5 kg (11 pounds) if your weight declaration is missing or for whatever reason unusable\\n\\nWhere we charge the base price based on our audit, price adjustments will appear on\\n\\nyour next or a later invoice.\\n\\nIf you don’t complete and send all the documents we require for a shipment, or if the\\n\\ndocuments are incorrect or incomplete for any reason, the items of the shipment may,\\n\\nat our discretion, be:\\n\\n\\n\\nReturned to you at your expense to make them compliant\\n\\n\\n\\nProcessed and charged at the next or most appropriate product or service category, where available, and/or made subject to an additional administrative surcharge\\n\\n\\n\\nRefused for shipping\\n\\nBesides the base price and administrative surcharge referred to above, we also apply\\n\\nother surcharges. See our Pricing page for more information.\\n\\n5.4 How we calculate base shipping price\\n\\nHere’s how we calculate the base price 1for shipping your item.\\n\\nWe use the greater of the item\\'s actual weight and volumetric equivalent of actual\\n\\nweight in the prescribed weight and size limits of the specific product offering used. We\\n\\nindicate this weight on the price sheets provided.\\n\\nTo confirm the base price for shipping your item:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nCalculate the item\\'s actual weight and the volumetric equivalent of its actual weight. For instructions on how to do that, see How to cube an item and calculate the VE of its actual weight.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTake the greater of these two numbers.\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 33\\n\\n3.\\n\\nRefer to our price sheets and find the base price associated with that number.\\n\\n1While the lowest base price for most services corresponds to the lowest actual weight or volumetric equivalent of\\n\\nactual weight of 0.750, some exceptions may apply. Where the greater of actual weight and volumetric equivalent\\n\\nof actual weight exceeds 0.750, we’ll determine the base price in all cases by rounding the actual weight and\\n\\nvolumetric equivalent of actual weight up to the nearest 0.500.\\n\\n5.5 How to cube an item and calculate the VE of its actual weight\\n\\nHere’s a step-by-step guide to cubing an item and calculating the volumetric equivalent\\n\\n(VE) of its actual weight.\\n\\n1. Measure the item\\'s dimensions\\n\\nMeasure your item\\'s length, width, and height where these dimensions are greatest.\\n\\nMeasure items of irregular shape in the same manner.\\n\\nYour item\\'s largest dimensions are the dimensions of the smallest box in which you can\\n\\ncontain the item.\\n\\nRegular shaped item\\n\\nIrregular shaped item\\n\\n2. Cube the item\\n\\nCalculate the item\\'s cube by multiplying its length, width, and height (as measured in\\n\\nstep 1).\\n\\nYour item\\'s cube (or cubic volume) is the amount of space it occupies, as if you\\n\\ncontained it in the smallest box referred to in step 1.\\n\\n3. Calculate the volumetric equivalent of the item\\'s actual weight\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 34\\n\\nCalculate the item\\'s volumetric equivalent of its actual weight by dividing its cube (or\\n\\ncubic volume), as measured in step 2, by a density factor.\\n\\nThe formula we use to calculate the volumetric equivalent of the item\\'s actual weight is:\\n\\nCubic volume / density factor = volumetric equivalent actual weight.\\n\\nThe density factor is a number that shows the fact that items weighing a certain\\n\\namount are generally of a certain size or volume.\\n\\nWe apply a density factor of 5,000 (when measuring in cubic cm) or 139 (when\\n\\nmeasuring in cubic inches) to:\\n\\n\\n\\nPriority™\\n\\n\\n\\nXpresspost™\\n\\n\\n\\nExpedited services™\\n\\n\\n\\nAll U.S. and International services (excluding Tracked Packet™ and Small Packet™)\\n\\nWe apply a density factor of 6,000 (when measuring in cubic cm) or 166 (when\\n\\nmeasuring in cubic inches) for the Regular Parcel™ service\\n\\nThere are some examples of calculations of volumetric equivalent of actual weight on\\n\\nthe next page.\\n\\nPlease note:\\n\\nVolumetric equivalent of actual weight isn’t a unit of measure, a mass,\\n\\nor a volume. It’s a tool developed according to an industry standard of\\n\\ntypical parcel densities that helps to calculate a more accurate shipping\\n\\nprice for an item\\'s weight and the space it occupies in a truck or an\\n\\nairplane.\\n\\n5.6 Examples of how to cube an item and calculate the VE of its actual weight\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\nAn item measures 100 cm x 60 cm x 20 cm with an actual weight of 8 kg. Based on the parcel\\'s dimensions, its volume is 120,000 cm3. If it were shipped using Xpresspost service, a density factor of 5,000 would apply, resulting in a volumetric equivalent of\\n\\nactual weight of 24.\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 35\\n\\nBecause the volumetric equivalent of actual weight of 24 is greater than the actual\\n\\nweight of 8 kg, the correct shipping charge is based on volumetric equivalent of 24.\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\nAn item measures 100 cm x 60 cm x 20 cm with an actual weight of 26 kg. Based on the parcel\\'s dimensions, its volume is 120,000 cm3. If it were shipped using Regular Parcel service, a density factor of 6,000 would apply, resulting in a volumetric equivalent of\\n\\nactual weight of 20.\\n\\nBecause the actual weight is greater than the volumetric equivalent of actual weight, the\\n\\ncorrect shipping charge is based on actual weight of 26 kg.\\n\\n6. Documentation\\n\\nYou must:\\n\\n\\n\\nApply proper shipping labels to the item\\n\\n\\n\\nInclude complete order documentation (manifest, bill of lading) with the item\\n\\nYou should produce all shipping labels according to our manufacturing specifications.\\n\\nLabels must be compliant with our specifications. These specifications exist to make\\n\\nsure that we can scan barcodes and that we can process items using our mechanized\\n\\nsorting equipment.\\n\\nSome services don’t need labels or documentation. For more information, consult the\\n\\nproper service in the Canada Postal Guide. If mailing outside of Canada, see our\\n\\nInternational destination listing tool and Customs requirements.\\n\\nPlease note: If you have a standing contract with Canada Post, you should also refer to\\n\\nthe Terms and Conditions of your contract.\\n\\nIn this section\\n\\nAffixing the shipping label to your item\\n\\nBarcoded shipping labels\\n\\nOrder (bill of lading)\\n\\nAdditional documentation\\n\\nCustoms documentation\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 36\\n\\nAffixing the shipping label to your item\\n\\nThe shipping label must be visible and affixed flat and wrinkle-free to the largest side of\\n\\nthe item.\\n\\nYou must not wrap the shipping label around the edges of the item or apply it in any\\n\\nmanner that makes it difficult to scan the barcode.\\n\\nFor more examples, see How to use our shipping labels.\\n\\nPlease note: •\\n\\nFor items smaller than the shipping label, wrapping the label around the edges is acceptable as long as you apply both the barcode and address section flat and they don’t wrap.\\n\\n\\n\\nAvoid placing the label over a seam or box closure.\\n\\n\\n\\nDon’t cover the label with strapping or reflective material such as tape.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor prepaid products specifically, make sure you apply labels straight, flat, and wrinkle-free in the area shown on the back of the envelope.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou must affix labels for cylindrical tubes lengthwise so that the sides of the barcode point towards the ends of the tube. This is to help with barcode scanning. The delivery guarantee doesn’t apply to cylindrical mailing tubes. We highly recommend the use of triangular or rectangular mailing tubes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen using our manual labels, make sure that no stickers or markings are on the 2D barcodes found in the corners of the “To” section. This could prevent our equipment from reading them properly. You must also remove the tear-away customer receipt.\\n\\nBarcoded shipping labels\\n\\nYou can print your own shipping label (if you use an online shipping tool or shipping\\n\\nsystem) or bring your item to the post office to get a barcoded shipping label.\\n\\nAlternatively, we offer barcoded prepaid envelopes and flat rate boxes that can be\\n\\npurchased online or at a post office.\\n\\nAffix the shipping label to the item, ensuring that:\\n\\nABCs of mailing\\n\\nPage 37\\n\\n•\\n\\nYou apply the label to the item as described in the section above\\n\\n\\n\\nThe label isn’t covered with reflective material (tape)\\n\\n\\n\\nThe barcode is of good quality so that postal equipment can read it\\n\\nPlease note: •\\n\\nYou can insert the label (and if applicable other shipping documentation) into a plastic pouch (labelope).

However, there are some exemptions.\\n\\nIn this section\\n\\nCustoms duty and taxes\\n\\nMail items valued at less than CAN$20\\n\\nGifts\\n\\nOther exemptions\\n\\nAppealing duty and tax assessments\\n\\nCustoms duty and taxes\\n\\nAny item mailed into Canada is potentially subject to duty and taxes, with few\\n\\nexceptions. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) collects provincial sales taxes\\n\\n(PST) and harmonized sales taxes (HST) according to the province of residence on\\n\\nmost taxable imports valued at over CAN$20.\\n\\nVisit CBSA online if you want to:\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn more about mail imports\\n\\n•\\n\\nAsk questions about the collection of taxes\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 9\\n\\n•\\n\\nGet more information on mail imports, duty, and taxes\\n\\nWe apply a handling fee of CAN$9.95 per dutiable or taxable mail item. This fee is in line\\n\\nwith the government’s efforts to help recover costs from those who benefit from\\n\\nservices. It\\'s also similar to arrangements in the United States and other countries.\\n\\nMail items containing merchandise enter Canada through CBSA screening centres.\\n\\nCBSA officers inspect and assess these items for applicable customs duties and taxes.\\n\\nIf you owe duties and taxes, you can now pay online instead of at the time of delivery\\n\\nwhen you track your item online or by using the Canada Post mobile app.\\n\\nWhen the item is eligible for you to pay online:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nClick the \"Pay\" button on screen.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nFollow the instructions to complete a secure online payment using a credit card.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nComplete the online payment.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nWait for an email confirmation that includes a number and barcode.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nShow this number and barcode as proof of payment if our delivery agent asks for it when your package arrives\\n\\nWhen you pay your duty and taxes online, and the package doesn’t need a signature, the\\n\\ndelivery agent will try to deliver the item to your usual delivery location. The delivery\\n\\nagent will also take into consideration your delivery preference (for example, leave at\\n\\nthe front door) if provided.\\n\\nIf you don’t pay online, we collect the fees on behalf of the CBSA at the time of delivery\\n\\nor pick up.\\n\\nWe accept the following methods of payment:\\n\\nBefore delivery:\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or American Express)\\n\\nThe acceptable methods of payment at the time of delivery:\\n\\nDelivered to customer\\'s address (via PDT) we accept:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nCredit Card\\n\\n2.\\n\\nCommercial Account\\n\\n3.\\n\\nProof of Payment (from online payment receipt)\\n\\nPick up at the Post office we accept:\\n\\n\\n\\nCash (CAD and USD)\\n\\n\\n\\nDebit Credit Card\\n\\n\\n\\nCheque\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 10\\n\\n•\\n\\nMoney Order\\n\\nRPOS has the ability to override payment if the customer provides their POP number.\\n\\nMail items valued at less than CAN$20\\n\\nThe CBSA doesn’t assess duty or tax on mail items valued at CAN$20 or less. But this\\n\\ngeneral rule doesn’t apply to certain products including:\\n\\n\\n\\nIntoxicating beverages\\n\\n\\n\\nCigarettes\\n\\n\\n\\nPublications where the supplier is required to register under the Excise Tax Act\\n\\n\\n\\nCigars\\n\\n\\n\\nManufactured tobacco\\n\\nAlso, you may not combine this with other exemptions. The CBSA doesn’t consider\\n\\nitems to be of low value in cases where you split a single transaction into smaller shipments to keep the value below CAN$20.\\n\\nGifts\\n\\nGifts from friends and relatives, valued at CAN$60 or less, are duty and tax exempt. In\\n\\ncases where the gift is valued at more than CAN$60, the CBSA will assess duties and\\n\\ntaxes on the extra amount. You must send the gift to the recipient personally and\\n\\ninclude a card or other notice indicating that it’s a gift. Items that don’t qualify as gifts\\n\\ninclude:\\n\\n\\n\\nTobacco\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertising material\\n\\n\\n\\nIntoxicating beverages\\n\\n\\n\\nItems sent by a business to a consumer in Canada and vice versa\\n\\nOther exemptions\\n\\nCustoms duty may not apply to certain products or products manufactured in certain\\n\\ncountries. For example, there are generally no customs duties applicable to products\\n\\nthat qualify under the Canada – United States – Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\\n\\nAppealing duty and tax assessments\\n\\nIf you believe the CBSA made an error in the assessment of duties and taxes, the CBSA\\n\\noffers two choices to facilitate the request for an adjustment:\\n\\nOption 1\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 11\\n\\nBoth businesses and consumers may ask for an adjustment before paying the amount\\n\\nshown online or on the E14 Invoice. In this case, you must:\\n\\n\\n\\nCheck the return to CBSA option on the E14 Invoice\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide a telephone number\\n\\nWe’ll return the package to the CBSA for a review of the duty and taxes shown on the\\n\\nE14 Invoice. As part of the process, the CBSA may contact the addressee to discuss the\\n\\nreasons for the review.\\n\\nOption 2\\n\\nYou may pay the amount online or at the time of delivery and then submit a request for\\n\\nan adjustment after payment and delivery. In this case, commercial importers must file\\n\\na Form B2 and consumers may file for a refund by following the instructions on the\\n\\nreverse side of the E14 Invoice.\\n\\nPlease note:\\n\\nIf you use Option 1, the CBSA won’t release the item for delivery until\\n\\nthey’ve completed their review. This means that we can’t deliver your\\n\\npackage until you pay the amounts owing, regardless if an adjustment\\n\\nis pending. So, you may wish to consider Option 2 because you’ll\\n\\nreceive the item while the appeal is processed. Please visit the CBSA\\n\\nwebsite for more information about appeals and adjustments.\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only.

Canadian requirements for exports\\n\\n5.1 Canadian requirements for exports overview\\n\\nThe following documentation is required to ensure safe arrival of your shipment in\\n\\nanother country.\\n\\nExport documentation\\n\\nYou need an Export Declaration when shipping the following goods to another country\\n\\n(excluding the U.S.):\\n\\n\\n\\nAll goods:\\n\\n\\n\\nValued at CAN$2,000 or more (including gifts, donations, and repairs)\\n\\n\\n\\nThat are controlled, prohibited, or regulated (regardless of value)\\n\\nThe CBSA is no longer accepting Paper Export Declaration Forms (B13A).\\n\\nThe Export Declaration can now be facilitated through The Canadian Export Reporting\\n\\nSystem (CERS), a free, web-based, self-service portal for submitting electronic\\n\\ndeclarations. If you’re currently submitting export declarations using the \\'G7 EDI\\'\\n\\nmethod and only plan on using this application, there’s no need to use the CERS portal.\\n\\nIf you wish to start using the CERS application, you may register by visiting the\\n\\nElectronic Data Interchange / Portal Clients website.\\n\\nIf you’ve never submitted electronic declarations you must register for the new CERS\\n\\nPortal to begin using it. Apply to register by completing and submitting form BSF831.\\n\\nAn Export Declaration isn’t required for goods that are exported for consumption in the\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\nFor more information visit the CBSA website.\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 21\\n\\nYou shouldn’t confuse an Export Declaration B13A with the customs declaration form\\n\\nreferred to in Completing customs documents. You must complete a customs\\n\\ndeclaration form for any mail containing merchandise that’s sent to a destination\\n\\noutside Canada.\\n\\nAlso, some products may need an export permit such as goods listed on the Export\\n\\nControl List (See also Mailing items abroad).\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only. All of this information is subject to change without notice,\\n\\nand we don\\'t guarantee its accuracy or completeness. It\\'s your responsibility to make sure that you are complying\\n\\nwith all applicable requirements when you send or receive international mail items.\\n\\n5.2 Money\\n\\nThere are several things you need to keep in mind when importing or exporting money\\n\\n(currency and monetary instruments).\\n\\nCurrency and monetary instruments for export\\n\\nYou must report to the CBSA all Canadian or foreign currency and monetary\\n\\ninstruments (CAN$10,000 or more) entering or exiting Canada through the mail.\\n\\nThese monetary instruments include:\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities including:\\n\\n\\n\\nStocks\\n\\n\\n\\nBonds\\n\\n\\n\\nDebentures and treasury bills\\n\\n\\n\\nNegotiable instruments including:\\n\\n\\n\\nBank drafts\\n\\n\\n\\nCheques\\n\\n\\n\\nPromissory notes\\n\\n\\n\\nTravellers’ cheques and money orders\\n\\n\\n\\nWarehouse receipts or bills of lading\\n\\n\\n\\nNegotiable instruments that bear a restrictive endorsement or stamp for the purpose of clearing\\n\\n\\n\\nNegotiable instruments that you make payable to a named person and you haven\\'t endorsed\\n\\nForeign currency and monetary instruments with a value of CAN$10,000 or more mailed\\n\\nout of the country must include a:\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 22\\n\\n•\\n\\nForm E667 (Cross-Border Currency or Monetary Instruments Report-General)\\n\\nYou must send a copy of form E667 to the nearest Canada Border Services Agency\\n\\noffice either:\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the same time as mailing the item\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore mailing the item\\n\\nVisit the CBSA website to access the online CBSA customs form.\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only.

A shipment may consist of several containers. The CBSA will stamp an\\n\\nExport Declaration attached to the certificate. Exporters must then send the declaration\\n\\nto the Kimberley Process Office within 7 days of the date of export.\\n\\nThe Kimberley Process Office address is:\\n\\nKIMBERLEY PROCESS OFFICE\\n\\nMINERALS AND METALS SECTOR\\n\\nNATURAL RESOURCES CANADA\\n\\n9TH FLOOR\\n\\n580 BOOTH STREET\\n\\nOTTAWA ON CANADA K1A 0E4\\n\\nVisit the Natural Resources Canada website for more information.\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only.

The sender must\\n\\nrequest the Prior Notice number electronically through the FDA Prior Notice System\\n\\nInterface and include the number on the customs documentation before shipping.\\n\\nThe FDA and U.S. Customs Border and Protection will use their own discretion and may\\n\\nconsider not taking any regulatory action when:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a Prior Notice violation\\n\\n\\n\\nThe commercially prepared food is being sent from one person to another person for non-commercial purposes\\n\\nYou ship these items at your own risk.\\n\\nIn spite of any product specification about liability coverage to the contrary, we’ll have\\n\\nno liability whatsoever for loss, delay, or damage of cross-border shipments containing\\n\\nfood. Likewise, you can\\'t buy liability coverage from us for cross-border shipments\\n\\ncontaining food.\\n\\nYou can visit the FDA website for more information.\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only.

It\\'s your responsibility to make sure that you are complying\\n\\nwith all applicable requirements when you send or receive international mail items.\\n\\n5.7 Prescription drugs to the U.S.\\n\\nSenders and recipients must be aware it’s completely at the discretion of the U.S. Food\\n\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) whether\\n\\nto allow entry of drugs into the U.S. Mailing of any items containing prescription drugs\\n\\nor any other FDA controlled or regulated products (for example, cosmetics) is solely at\\n\\nyour own risk.\\n\\nYou can visit the FDA website for more information.\\n\\nThe position of CBP is that, in virtually all instances, individual citizens aren’t allowed to\\n\\nimport prescription drugs into the United States. When CBP brings personal shipments\\n\\nof drugs and devices that appear violative to the FDA’s attention, FDA personnel will use\\n\\ntheir discretion to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to detain, refuse, or allow\\n\\nentry of the product. The FDA may allow a person entering the United States to import a 3-month supply of an unopened drug if:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe intended use (of the drug) isn’t approved and for a serious condition for which effective treatment may not be available domestically either through commercial or\\n\\nCustoms requirements\\n\\nPage 25\\n\\nclinical means.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThere’s no known commercialization or promotion to people living in the U.S. by those involved in the product\\'s distribution.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nThe FDA considers the product not to be an unreasonable risk.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nThe person wanting to import the product affirms in writing that it’s for their own use (no more than a 3-month supply) and either:\\n\\n\\n\\nGives the name and address of the doctor licensed in the U.S. responsible for their treatment with the product\\n\\n\\n\\nOffers evidence that the product is for the continuation of a treatment begun in a foreign country (outside the U.S.).\\n\\nPlease note: The second bullet under item 4 may apply to Canadian citizens visiting the\\n\\nU.S. Thus, you should supply documentation to show that this factor exists.\\n\\nThis required documentation might include:\\n\\n\\n\\nA U.S. or foreign prescription\\n\\n\\n\\nAn affirmation of personal use\\n\\n\\n\\nProof of Canadian citizenship\\n\\nIn spite of any product specification about liability coverage to the contrary, we’ll have\\n\\nno liability whatsoever for loss, delay, or damage of cross-border shipments containing\\n\\ndrugs.\\n\\nLikewise, despite any provision to the contrary, you can\\'t buy liability coverage from us\\n\\nfor cross-border shipments containing drugs.\\n\\nYou can visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website for more information.\\n\\nWe’re providing this information as a convenience only.
